abstract: "We consider fair graph representation learning via data augmentations. While
this direction has been explored previously, existing methods invariably rely on
certain assumptions on the properties of fair graph data in order to design fxed
strategies on data augmentations. Nevertheless, the exact properties of fair graph
data may vary signifcantly in different scenarios. Hence, heuristically designed
augmentations may not always generate fair graph data in different application
scenarios. In this work, we propose a method, known as Graphair, to learn fair representations based on automated graph data augmentations. Such fairness-aware
augmentations are themselves learned from data. Our Graphair is designed to automatically discover fairness-aware augmentations from input graphs in order to
circumvent sensitive information while preserving other useful information. Experimental results demonstrate that our Graphair consistently outperforms many
baselines on multiple node classifcation datasets in terms of fairness-accuracy
trade-off performance. In addition, results indicate that Graphair can automatically learn to generate fair graph data without prior knowledge on fairness-relevant
graph properties. Our code is publicly available as part of the DIG package
(https://github.com/divelab/DIG)."
